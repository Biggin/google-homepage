Link to the course I'm taking that taught me how to set-up this Github and all of the cool coding stuff that I'm still yet to learn....

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

--After Google Search Page Design--
	So, I've learned more about what I don't know yet and what I'm still so far from understanding than what I'm confident with and feel like I've got a good grasp on in HTML/CSS. It seems so simple while reading about it and doing a little practice here and there as you go along. In theory it is but in practice I actually realize that I'm so far from the goal that I've laid out for myself. It actually surprised me how good that "I" got this project to turn out, with it being my first real try at actually coding something. I'm super excited about the journey that I'm on and hopefully The Odin Project will help me to accomplish my goals and switch careers to the IT field. I encourage anyone reading this to send me a message with any constuctive criticism/advice.
I'm sure that after reading my code that a seasoned coder would have many things to say about the layout and structure, because I don't really have a clue what I'm doing yet. It will get better with time though and I look forward to being able to look back at this one day and being able to laugh at how atrocious my own code was. It's all about progress and learning and you have to start somewhere, it seems such a daunting task when you don't understand most of the concepts but practice, practice, practice.....
Thanks to my beautiful wife and children and everyone that has and will help me along the way!!!
